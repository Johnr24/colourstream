# Project Intelligence

## Key Patterns

*   Using Go + React (with Typescript) for full-stack development.
*   Integrating Ovenplayer and Mirotalk for live streaming.
*   Securing the application with Traefik and Let's Encrypt.

## Tool Usage Patterns

*   Using `write_to_file` to create and update memory bank files.
*   Using `replace_in_file` to modify existing files (but it seems to be failing, so using `write_to_file` instead).

## Challenges

*   `replace_in_file` tool is not working as expected.

## Decisions

*   Using `write_to_file` as a workaround for `replace_in_file`.
