- Email: security@johnrogerscolour.co.uk


Please include the following information in your report:

1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Potential impact of the vulnerability
4. Any potential mitigations you've identified

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 3 business days.
- **Communication**: We will keep you informed of our progress as we work to validate and address the issue.
- **Validation**: We will validate the issue and determine its severity and impact.
- **Resolution**: Once validated, we will develop and test a fix.
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline.

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Use strong password policies
   - Implement proper session management
   - Apply the principle of least privilege
   - Regularly audit access controls

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Implement proper data retention policies
   - Regularly backup critical data
   - Sanitize data before display

4. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Keep all systems and dependencies up to date
   - Use secure configurations for all services
   - Implement network segmentation
   - Regularly scan for vulnerabilities

### For Users

1. **Account Security**
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication when available
   - Be cautious of phishing attempts
   - Log out from shared devices

2. **Data Handling**
   - Be mindful of the data you share
   - Regularly review your shared content
   - Report any suspicious activities

## Security Updates

We regularly update our dependencies and systems to address security vulnerabilities. Critical security updates will be applied promptly.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure principles:

1. We will respond to security reports as quickly as possible
2. We will keep reporters informed of our progress
3. We will give proper credit to security researchers who report issues according to our responsible disclosure policy
4. We will not take legal action against researchers who follow our responsible disclosure policy

## NPM Dependency Security Scanning

The ColourStream project implements automated security scanning for npm dependencies using GitHub Actions. This ensures that security vulnerabilities in dependencies are regularly identified and addressed.

### Automated Scanning

The repository uses a GitHub Actions workflow to run npm audit scans:

1. **Schedule**: Scans run automatically:
   - On every push or pull request that changes package.json or package-lock.json files
   - Weekly on Sunday at midnight (scheduled scan)
   - Manually when triggered through GitHub Actions interface

2. **Reports**: The workflow generates:
   - JSON reports capturing raw audit data
   - HTML reports for easier analysis
   - A summary in the GitHub Actions run

3. **Access Reports**: To view reports:
   - Go to the Actions tab in the GitHub repository
   - Select the "NPM Security Audit" workflow
   - Choose a completed workflow run
   - Download the artifacts containing the reports

### Running Scans Locally

You can run security scans locally using the npm scripts defined in the root package.json:

```bash
# Run audit on all packages (root, frontend, backend)
npm run audit:all

# Run audit on a specific package
npm run audit:root
npm run audit:frontend
npm run audit:backend

# Attempt to automatically fix vulnerabilities
npm run audit:fix
```

### Addressing Vulnerabilities

When vulnerabilities are discovered:

1. Check if the vulnerability affects your application's usage of the package
2. Update the vulnerable package to a patched version when possible
3. If no patched version is available:
   - Consider alternatives to the vulnerable package
   - Implement mitigation strategies as recommended
   - Document accepted risks if the vulnerability cannot be addressed

4. For critical vulnerabilities:
   - Create a GitHub issue to track the vulnerability
   - Assign priority based on severity and exploitation risk
   - Set a timeline for resolution

### Security Audit Standards

We follow these standards for dependency security:

- All direct dependencies should be regularly updated
- Critical and high vulnerabilities should be addressed immediately
- Moderate vulnerabilities should be addressed in the next release cycle
- Low vulnerabilities should be documented and addressed when convenient
