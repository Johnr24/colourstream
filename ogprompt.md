Now it's time to build the colourstream end product, 
I am looking for a live page which has both the ovenplayer player which is in the ovenplayer folder and has the actual .js file in  ovenplayer/src/js/ovenplayer.js and a mirotalk window benealf the ovenplayer window, there should be zero margin, they should both take up the full width of the screen and together the full height of the window, 


the end user page (all of above) of this needs to be behind a password protected page

these pages needs to be adminsteratable from admin portal, the admin portal needs to be secure and and provide the ability to delete and spawn rooms from the same page, as well as create rooms with custom link names, 

the name of the ovenplayer stream key and the name of the mirotalk room should be the same and randomly generateable from the admin portal, 

please pick the most sutible technology to create this and please intergrate this with trafik, the enduser pages should be on the /path of the colourstream domain, the admin portal should be accessible at admin.colourstream.johnrogerscolour.co.uk
Please look at newer languages, which are generally faster and use less resources
