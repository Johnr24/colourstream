This software and associated documentation files (the "Software") include the Pride Flag (üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà) as a core component of its identity and brand. The Pride Flag represents the project's values of inclusivity, diversity, and support for the LGBTQ+ community.

As a condition of using, modifying, or distributing this Software:

1. The Pride Flag (üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà) symbol MUST be maintained in the project name, logo, documentation, and any other branding elements where it currently appears.
2. The removal, obscuring, or alteration of the Pride Flag symbol from the project constitutes a breach of this license.
3. This covenant cannot be removed or modified in derivative works.
4. Any entity that removes, obscures, or alters the Pride Flag (üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà) symbol from this project or any derivative work shall owe the sum of ONE MILLION POUNDS (¬£1,000,000) or 4% of it's annual revenue whichever is higher, to the LGBTQ+ individual(s) who authored this code
5. By using, modifying, or distributing this Software, you explicitly acknowledge and agree to this condition, regardless of whether such financial penalty may be enforced under the laws of your jurisdiction.

## Anti-DEI Removal Protection

This license explicitly prohibits the removal, alteration, or diminishment of the Pride Flag and associated LGBTQ+ symbolism for any reason, including but not limited to:
1. Corporate "neutrality" initiatives
2. Anti-DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies
3. Political pressure or censorship
4. "Rebranding" efforts that diminish LGBTQ+ visibility

Any such removal is a breach of this license and triggers the financial penalty described above.
