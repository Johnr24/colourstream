# PostgreSQL Setup for ColourStream

This document outlines the streamlined process to set up PostgreSQL for the ColourStream application.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Access to the ColourStream repository

## Setup Steps

### 1. Configuration Files

The following files have been updated to support PostgreSQL:

- `docker-compose.yml`: Added PostgreSQL service
- `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`: Updated datasource provider to PostgreSQL
- `backend/.env`: Updated DATABASE_URL to use PostgreSQL
- `global.env`: Added PostgreSQL environment variables
- `backend/Dockerfile`: Added PostgreSQL client
- `backend/docker-entrypoint.sh`: Updated to wait for PostgreSQL and use migrations

### 2. Deploy the Changes

```bash
# Stop the current services
docker-compose down

# Build and start the services with the new configuration
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Verify the Setup

```bash
# Check PostgreSQL logs
docker-compose logs postgres

# Check backend logs
docker-compose logs backend

# Access Prisma Studio to verify the database schema
docker-compose exec backend npx prisma studio
```

### 4. Test the Application

- Test all functionality to ensure it works with PostgreSQL
- Verify that data is being properly stored and retrieved

### 5. Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues are encountered:

```bash
# Stop the services
docker-compose down

# Restore the original configuration files
git checkout -- docker-compose.yml backend/prisma/schema.prisma backend/.env global.env

# Restart the services with the original configuration
docker-compose up -d
```

## Core Benefits of PostgreSQL

1. **Scalability**: PostgreSQL is better suited for handling larger datasets and concurrent users.
2. **Advanced Features**: Access to advanced SQL features, JSON support, and better indexing.
3. **Reliability**: PostgreSQL offers better data integrity and transaction support.
4. **Performance**: Better query performance for complex operations.
5. **Ecosystem**: Wider range of tools and extensions available.

## Conclusion

This setup provides a ready-to-use PostgreSQL database for the ColourStream application, leveraging the core advantages of PostgreSQL without unnecessary complexity.
