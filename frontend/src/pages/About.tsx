              <p className="govuk-body">
                ColourStream is designed to be fully self-hosted, providing several key advantages:
              </p>
              <ul className="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>üö´ <strong>No Enshittification:</strong> Avoid the common problem of platforms degrading quality or introducing unwanted changes to maximize profit</li>
                <li>üëë <strong>Complete Control:</strong> You own and control your entire workflow and data</li>
                <li>üîè <strong>Data Privacy:</strong> Client media stays on your systems, not on third-party servers</li>
                <li>üîÑ <strong>Customizability:</strong> Modify and adapt the platform to your specific workflow needs</li>
                <li>üí∞ <strong>No Subscription Fees:</strong> Pay only for your hosting costs, not per-user or feature fees</li>
                <li>üîí <strong>Independence:</strong> Your tools won't disappear due to company shutdowns, acquisitions, or policy changes</li>
              </ul>

                ensuring they remain stable, private, and tailored to actual needs rather than corporate profit motives.
